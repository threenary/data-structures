# Data Structures

### What is this
This a plain and simple repository to play with data structures, approaching solutions to common interview test cases in a TDD manner.

### Who is this intended for
This repository is born with the idea to remain as source of truth for recurrent questions and topics that are not used to deal on daily basis, and with the idea to grow it based on experience and exercises.
